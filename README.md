# Custom-Transformer-based-Text-Summarizer
Implemented a custom Transformer architecture in PyTorch for abstractive text summarization, designing encoderâ€“decoder layers with multi-head attention and positional encoding.  Integrated the model into a full-stack application with a Flask backend and React frontend, enabling real-time text summarization via a web interface.
